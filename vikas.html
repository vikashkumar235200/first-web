    <h1 style="color:aqua">What is management?</h1>
    <p style="color:green">Management is the process of planning and organising the resources and <br> activities of a
        business to achieve specific goals in the most effective <br> and efficient manner possible. Efficiency in
        management refers <br> to the completion of tasks correctly and at minimal costs. Effectiveness <br> in

    <h1 style=" color:aquamarine">Characteristics of management</h1>
    <p style="color:brown">Some of the fundamental characteristics of management are as follows:</p>
    <h2 style="color: hotpink;">Multi-dimensional</h2>
    <p style="color: pink;">Most management oversees and supervises a company or organisation's <br> service or
        production cycle. Managers work closely with and provide guidance to the members of their team. <br> A manager
        considers a staff member both as an individual with diverse needs and as a component of the larger <br> To be
        effective, managers influence their team members to apply their unique <br> strengths toward achieving the
        organisation's goals.</p>

    <h1 style="color: orange;">Dynamic</h1>
    <p style="color: olivedrab;">
        Management is a dynamic function and evolves and adapts to changes <br> in its environment, whether they are
        economic, socio-political or technological. <br> For instance, a paper company could see a decline <br> in sales
        because of the rapid adoption of screens and digital devices. <br> Whether the company can still survive depends
        on how effectively its <br> management can adapt to new market requirements.</p>
    <h1 style="color: mediumspringgreen;">Intangible</h1>
    <p style="color: honeydew;">
        Management is not a tangible product, but its presence can change <br> the way an organisation functions.
        Management consists of ideologies,<br> policies and human interaction. Good management helps improve a company's
        <br> target achievement ratios, employee gratification levels and overall ease in the company's operation.
    </p>
    <h1 style="color: navy;">Objectives of management</h1>
    <p style="color: salmon;">
        Management can have mainly three types of objectives:</p>
    <h2 style="color: greenyellow;">Organisational objectives</h2>
    <p style="color: khaki;">
        Management should consider the interests of all company stakeholders,<br> including employees, customers and the
        government. Managers are responsible <br> for setting and achieving goals for the organisation. Typically,<br>
        the primary aim of an organisation is to achieve growth by utilising <br> its human, material and financial
        resources. There are three <br> general organisational objectives for any company:</p>


    <ul>
        <li style="color: peru;"><b style="color: darkcyan;">Survival:</b> An organisation needs to generate enough
            revenues to cover its operational costs.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: magenta;"><b style="color: black;">Profit:</b> Profit provides incentive and is essential for
            covering unprecedented costs and risks associated with running a business.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: burlywood;"><b>Growth:</b> You can measure the growth of a business in terms of increases in
            sales volume, workforce and capital investment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color: darkorange;">
    <h2 style="color: firebrick;">Social objectives</h2>
    To an extent, the management is also responsible for creating benefits for the society through their work. Companies
    choose to do this in different ways. Some may incorporate environment-friendly methods of production, while others
    implement fair wages and opportunities. Larger companies often maintain or fund initiatives that provide basic
    amenities like healthcare and education. Based on the scale of their operations, companies often initiate CSR
    (Corporate Social Responsibility) campaigns that benefit society in different ways</p>

    <h2 style="color: gold: ;;">Personnel objectives</h2>
    <p style="color: blueviolet;">The management typically decides the financial incentives, salaries, perks and social
        initiatives for their employees. Activities that improve peer recognition and interaction like corporate outings
        and holiday bonuses cater to the personnel's social growth and development.</p>

    <h1 style="color: aqua;">Importance of management</h1>

    Here are some reasons management is important:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: orange;"><b>Helps in achieving group goals:</b> Effective management gives a common direction
            to individual efforts and guides them towards achieving the overall goals of an organisation.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: orange;"><b>Increases efficiency:</b> Efficiency reduces costs and increases productivity in
            all spheres of an organisation's work.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: blue;"><b>Creates a dynamic organisation:</b> Management helps its personnel in adapting to
            change so that the organisation continues to maintain its competitive edge. How well an organisation can
            respond and adapt to change can mean the difference between its success and failure.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: darkcyan;"><b>Helps in achieving personal objectives:</b> Effective management fosters team
            spirit, cooperation and commitment to achieve the organisational goals as a group, which helps each term
            member achieve their personal objectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 style="color: darkorange;">Levels of management</h1>
    <p>
        Management roles come in three levels:

    </p>

    <h2 style="color: darkolivegreen;">1. Top management</h2>
    <p style="color: goldenrod;">
        Typically, the senior-most executives in a company are the chairman, chief executive officer, chief operating
        officer, president and vice-president. Their role lies in integrating diverse components of the company and
        coordinating activities of different departments. They also analyse the business environment and its
        implications to formulate goals in order to ensure the survival of the company and the welfare of its
        stakeholders.</p>
    <h2 style="color: firebrick;">2. Middle management</h2>
    <p style="color: lawngreen;">
        Mostly composed of division heads, the middle management links the operational management to the top management.
        Division/department heads receive guidance from top managers and are leaders to operational managers. Their job
        is to understand the policies framed by the top management and relay them to their respective
        divisions/departments to ensure that they follow through with company policies and decisions.</p>
    <h2 style="color: green;">3. Operational management</h2>
    <p style="color: aqua;">
        Supervisors, section leads or forepersons directly oversee the efforts of the workforce. They are responsible
        for quality control and ensure that the work meets deadlines. The top management draws out the plans that define
        the authority and responsibility of supervisors.</p>
